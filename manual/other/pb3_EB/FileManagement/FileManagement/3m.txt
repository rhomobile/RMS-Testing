5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port. 
4.1 WS5000 Switch
			IP Address: 172.26.10.2
			Username: admin (Case sensitive)

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port. 
4.1 WS5000 Switch

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port. 
4.1 WS5000 Switch
			IP Address: 172.26.10.2
			Username: admin (Case sensitive)

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port. 
4.1 WS5000 Switch

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port. 
4.1 WS5000 Switch

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port. 
4.1 WS5000 Switch

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port. 
4.1 WS5000 Switch
			IP Address: 172.26.10.2
			Username: admin (Case sensitive)

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port. 
4.1 WS5000 Switch

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port. 
4.1 WS5000 Switch

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port. 
4.1 WS5000 Switch

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

5.	Symbol Switches
We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.

We have two switches WS5000 and WS2000 which the various Access ports. You should use switches if you want to test ‘g’ and ‘a’ radio in symbol. Presently there is a problem in operating the 5k and 2k switches simultaneously. Hence the 2k is disconnected from the network when 5k is in operation. When one needs to execute test cases related to 2k switches unplug the Ethernet cable from the 5000 switches and plug it into any of the first 4 ports of the 2000 switch, which is unconnected to the network. Symbol switches controls the following Access ports

Access port 		  Radio                         	         ESSID
           Supported                          Broadcasting (At a Time)

 - AP100 ??? Only ‘b’ Radio ???????? 4 ESSID

		 - AP200 ??? ‘b’ and ‘a’ Radio	 ??????? 8 ESSID

			 - AP300 ??? ‘b’, ‘g’ and ‘a’ Radio ????? 16 ESSID
	
Each type Access Port has two different MAC addresses 
1)	Device MAC address.
2)	Radio MAC address. 
Every Access port has different Radio MAC address for each supported radio that is different from Device MAC address of the Access port.
