  No. Not at all!! Though this is one way of conveying the meaning, it takes us away from
  the main objective of testing
  
  Testing is the process of uncovering defects... The objective of any tester should be to
  try his best to crack the code. This should not be seen as a destructive activity which points fingers at or find faults with the developers. In fact, testing should be considered as a healthy feedback mechanism to the developer community so that they can make maximum use of the defects found during testing, analyze them, find the root cause & devise appropriate preventive mechanisms. Actually, the defects found during testing helps improving the quality of the code!
  
  A tester should never work under the assumption that the system works!! The software product should be tested with the intent of finding errors. The test, which when executed reveals a defect in the software, is a success. Though Testing, by itself, does not improve the quality of the software product, it is an indicator of the quality. Rather that considering Testing
  as a separate phase in the SDLC, it should be an activity which is integrated into each & every phase. The intent should be to Analyze & Test, Design & Test, Develop & Test, Fix Defects & Test more...!! "
