If computer connected to several networks, it has several IP addresses in different networks.

When Webrick server starts it looks for IP address in external network, which may be different from IP address in WIFI network (with connected device)

To fix this issue server.rb now understand IP address as a parameter. For Example:
ruby server.rb 169.254.2.2

To find out correct IP address run ipconfig command and see what network connection you have.
When start server with WIFI or Network adapter IP and verify it on Device: run IE, and navigate to:
http://169.254.2.2:8081/test_methods
https://169.254.2.2:8082/test_methods
https://169.254.2.2:8083/test_methods

If they works, build application and run tests.
